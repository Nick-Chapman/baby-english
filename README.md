# baby-english

Construct a grammar for English, incrementally, driven by a corpus of sample sentences.

Aim to always be able to parse eveything, even when words are not understood, by using blah-blah rules. Incrementally refine the grammar with real grammatical knowledge, lexically driven, focussing on thhe common words of the corpus, especially words from bounded POS catagories.

Measure progress as a combination blah-blah reduction, whilst keeping ambiguity in check.

The goal of this project is the development of the process, as well as the resulting grammar/parser.
